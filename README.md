## Hello there



I'm Gabriel, a dedicated full-stack developer with a background in teaching English and a degree in Physical Education.

During the 2020 pandemic, as I entered the incredible milestone of turning 20, I realized that I wasn't on the path I had believed in when I was younger‚Äîa path that would provide me with experiences and a life worth living. That's why I quit my job as an English instructor and my internship and second degree in physical education to pursue a career in development. Fortunately, I made the right decision! Now, it's about living the life I've chosen.








## Detailed information

* **Name**: Gabriel Dos Santos Souto    
* **Age**: 23
* **Living in**: the moment (but geographically in S√£o Gabriel - RS, Brazil).
* **Stack**: Typescript, NodeJS, C#, Java, ReactJS, SQL, CSS.
* **University**: I don't hold a degree in development, only certificates from bootcamps and courses. However, I am a P.E teacher üèÄ.
