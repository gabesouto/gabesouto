# 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I'm Gabriel, diving into programming since 2022, mainly geeking out on back-end development with a sweet spot for Java. In my pre-coding life, I worked as an English teacher for over 2 years and secured a degree in Physical Education.

My backstory? It's a bit of a mixed bag—I've got teaching English and a Physical Education degree in the blend. Those experiences turned me into a problem-solving, team-loving enthusiast.

Looking ahead, I'm all about leveling up my coding and personal skills, Excited to jump into collaborative coding adventures, Currently open to new opportunities! :)
